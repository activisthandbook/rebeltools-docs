This documentation website was built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), and is hosted using the free [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) plan. Everytime we commit an update of our articles to GitHub, this website automatically gets updated.

Here's how to set up your own documentation site:
1. [Create a Docusaurus project](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/installation)
2. [Configure docusaurus.config.js](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/deployment#deploying-to-netlify) to work with Netlify
3. Create a [new Netlify project](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/deployment#deploying-to-netlify) with the following build settings:
    - build command: ```npm run build```
    - build directory: ```build```
